                Well done Nadith. You presented well. Your used good eye contact and open body language.

                You answered most questions clearly and your strength was in talking about your accomplishments and overcoming challenges.

                Areas for improvement would be to clearly end your sentences. You tended to say úm’and yeah as finishing remarks. Really focus on the skills and strengths you already have and use them to promote yourself to the employer.

                <div class="des">I received feedback from  miss. Tracy Glazier for the mock interview that I have done with her june 7 2024 and she gave me the areas that I should improve and they are to clearly end the sentences and focus on the strength and skills I already have and I have took a step and started to respond to it by remaking the sentences I already have with adding more strength and skill and also made the end of the sentence clear. </div>
