                    I have conducted a mockinterview with my EIF teacher and have created a resume, as you can see below. I had to experience what it would feel like to be in an interview and the mockinterview gave me a great opportunity to get experience and to be ready for the interview that I will be getting, and as for the resume I made it to know what a resume contain and to get knowledge about how to create one in the future so that I can show myself to the interviewer.
