            <div class="des">I do this action because it is a task that was given to all year 10 and also because, Everyone needs work experience to find a job or get a job. I’m doing this in order to get work experience.
                I am doing this action because when I am finished with the task I would have experience on how to work in a workplace so It would be easier for me to apply for a job if I needed in the future.
                I have two things that I need to get from this and they are that I need to have a part time job when I’m 18 and that’s because our visa is going to expire in 2026 and if I manage to get into a university and get student visa I will no longer have my parents to pay me for my day to day life and I’m not looking for it either. But I also like to have some experience in wood workplaces so I will have some knowledge on how others work in working places and to get used to it. Because the work experience only one week and I would not be able to get much knowledge about workplaces and also because it's critical for me to have a part time job when I'm 18 I chose to get a job that matches the first one.
