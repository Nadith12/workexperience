            <span style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Challenges</span>
             
            <div class="des1">My action was to find a workplace that I could go and get work experience, in that case, the whole action was a challenge on it’s own. Because it is hard to look for a place that is matching for our career, nearby, child safe and a place where there is a free role that is open for someone who only can lend a hand to there work and take experience. So I talked with my parents and we still reached out and was searching for a place where I could get work experience but it wasn’t enough so we had to get assistance from the SACE coordinator (miss. Povey) on reaching out to workplaces. Thanks to Ms. Povey, I was able to secure a workplace where I could gain experience in woodworking. Another challenge I faced was my lack of interview experience, which left me feeling unconfident. However, through the EFI subject, I had the opportunity to conduct a mock interview with my teacher. This experience provided me with valuable insights on how to perform in an interview and boosted my confidence.</div>
